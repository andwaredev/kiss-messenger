Guild Take Home Project

- Need to distinguish one user from another
- Need to be able to tie one piece of text (message) to two users (sender & receiver)
- Need to be able to recall messages for a given recipient/sender pair
- No need to impl auth, but I think it should be fairly reasonable to sub in real auth in the future.
- API documentation -> Swagger?
- Testing -> unit tests, e2e?

* Creativity
* Clarity
* Design Decisions
* Understanding the challenges of the problem
* Being able to extrapolate further
